# Marketing Mix Modelling using Meta's Robyn

- WIP -

### Executive Summary
Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) analysis for a new bakery business that my sister just launched to optimize marketing budget allocation across digital channels that my sister planned to use (IG, TikTok, search). 
Using Meta's `Robyn` framework with 2 years of simulated data (Jan 2022 - Dec 2024, simulated using Meta's `SiMMMulator` package in R), 
this project aims to identify the most effective channels and optimal spend distribution to maximize the bakery's revenue.


Key Findings:

Model Performance: R² = 72% (strong fit for simulated data without external factors)
